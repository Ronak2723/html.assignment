    <p>My name is Ronak, I am from India I live in Anand City, which is in Gujarat state, it is also know as milk city of India. So, I am an international student here and I am here to pursue my diploma program which takes 2 years to complete. The course I am studying is Interactive Media Design.</p>
    <p>Talking as an international student it is too hard to live in Canada. Like I donâ€™t know so much of rules here and, I am not getting set with food and timing. Soo I am exploring many things here about culture and how the system works here. Also, here we have to face problems alone and that is the big thing which also impact on studies. So, I am trying to manage the things.</p>
